\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
In the introduction~\ref{sec:goals} I stated the goals of this study.

The main objective was to implement a state-of-the-art algorithm and compare its performance with a commercial system.
Given that the performance of my system exceeded that of commercial one by two percents, I would consider the goals
of this thesis as completed.

\section{Possible Improvements}\label{sec:possible-improvements}
I have two ideas which could lead to the improvements in system's performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Fitting the model on relevant identities.} The model used at the core of the system (ResNet-18) was
    fitted on identities which are not relevant in the context of the system's application.
    While this is not an issue as the model works well on open-set\footnote{See footnote on page~\pageref{foot:openset}}
    problems, fine-tuning\footnote{A process of taking the weights of a trained neural network and using them as
    an initialization for a new model being trained on a data from the same domain.} the model again is one way to
    improve the system.
    \item \textit{Better face detection engine.} An area where the system is lacking is the face detection engine.
    The detector available in the EyeFace SDK~\ref{subsec:eyeface} seems to be significantly more robust than the one
    used in this work.
    This manifested itself when looking at the images of faulty MTCNN detection (see~\ref{fig:faulty_bbox}).
    EyeFace detector is better at handling edge cases (e.g. white stripe over part of the face).
    Such edge cases lead to MTCNNÂ producing false negatives.
\end{itemize}
