\chapter{Facial Recognition}\label{ch:face-rec}
Facial recognition is a task of verifying or identifying a person from digital image/video.

As I mentioned in the definition, there are two main subtasks~\cite{FaceRec}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Verification} deals with verifying whether the person in the image is who he claims he is.
    Typical modern use case of verification is smartphone unlocking with face.
    An example of such system is Face ID developed by Apple Inc.

    \item \textbf{Identification} is a task of matching a person to an identity.
    To formulate it in another way, the goal of identification is to give us an answer to the question of who the person
    in the image is.
\end{enumerate}
