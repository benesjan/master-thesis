\end{center}

I, Jan Beneš, declare that this thesis titled, “Automatic face recognition using neural networks” and the work 
presented in it are my own.

I confirm that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
    \item Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given.
    With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.
    \item I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
\end{itemize}
